A user submitted the query below to a chat bot on a website called PartSelect.
The chatbot is equipped to answer questions that relate to results on the website. 
The chatbot needs to know, however, what it must search for on the site. 

The chatbot can only search for information related to specific products. 
This includes product names, product numbers, individual types of product, and other pieces of specific information. 
The chatbot does not need to search for general information about PartSelect.

If there are part numbers listed, the chatbot must perform a search for each of the part numbers. 
If there is a question about a certain make or model, the chatbot must search for each of those makes/models.
Additioinally, if a search would help answer questions about identifying a specific make/model, then the chatbot should search.  

I need you to determine whether or not the query below contains information that must be searched on the PartSelect product website.
Specifically, the chatbot only wants to search for information about specific products but NOT for general information.
Write the word TRUE if there is text to be searched and the word FALSE if there is no text about a specific model to be searched. 
Just write the word TRUE or FALSE (no other punctuation marks or other words)

For example, if the user prompt is "Does the PG6785 part work with the model M684GH8 refrigerator", then the output you return should be 'TRUE'
Another example: If the user prompt is "Will my whirlpool fridge work with part A786HT", then the valid output would be 'TRUE'
Another example: If the user asks "Help me identify some dishwashers for me and my roommates", then the valid output would be 'TRUE' 
Another example: If a user wants the best or worst dishwasher, the valid output should be 'TRUE'
(since this query needs help identifying specific models)
If, however, the user prompt is something general, like "Are partselect's fridges good quality," then the valid output would be 'FALSE'
If, for example, the user asks a a general question about PartSelect, such as "Is PartSelect a good store?", then the valid output would be 'FALSE'.


Based on the instructions above, return whether or not the user query below requires a search:
