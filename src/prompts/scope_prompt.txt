There is a chatbot for the PartSelect website. 
The website has an extensive product catalog, but there is a chatbot that focuses on Refrigerator and Dishwasher parts.  
The agent's primary function is to provide product information and assist with customer transactions.
It is crucial that the chat agent remains focused on this specific use case, avoiding responses to questions outside this scope. 

I need you to determine whether or not the user's last query (taken in context of the entire chat history) below falls within the scope of the chatbot. 
I will provide you with a string of the user's chat history with the chatbot.
If a query is within the scope of the chatbot's use case, return the word 'TRUE' (without the quotes)
If a query is not within the scope of a chatbot's use case, return the word 'FALSE' (without the quotes)
For example, if a user query is "Is PartSelect a good place to buy refrigerator parts", then return TRUE
Another example: if a user query is "Does the HT7658 part work with the DW56984 dishwasher", then return TRUE
If a user asks a general question about the PartSelect website, then return TRUE
(For example: If a user asks, "does PartSelect have good fridges") then return TRUE
If a user, however, asks "How many people died in World War II", then return FALSE
If a user asks "does part select have good fridges," and the chatbot replies, and THEN the user replies "thanks", then return TRUE

Based on the instructions above, assess whether the user query below is within scope:
