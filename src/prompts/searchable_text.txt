A user submitted the query below to a chat bot on a website called PartSelect.
The chatbot is equipped to answer questions that relate to results on the website. 
The chatbot needs to know, however, what it must search for on the site. 

If there are part numbers listed, the chatbot must perform a search for each of the part numbers. 
If there is a question about a certain make or model, the chatbot must search for each of those makes/models.
Additionally, the chatbot must search for any other relevant information that the user prompt contains that might be on the PartSelect website. 

I need you to determine which queries the chatbot should run and return them as a comma separated list, with each entry contained within quotes.
If there are no queries to be run, return "NO QUERIES"
Just write the comma separated quoted list of queries, or the word "NO QUERIES" (in quotes)
Do not include any other words or punctuation marks outside of the instructions

For example, if the user prompt is "Does the PG6785 part work with the model M684GH8 refrigerator", then the output you return should be '"PG6785","M684GH8"'
Another example: If the user prompt is "Will my whirlpool fridge work with part A786HT", then one valid output would be '"whirlpool fridge part compatibility","A786HT"'

Based on the instructions above, return the queries that the chatbot must run on the prompt below:

--- USER PROMPT BELOW ---
